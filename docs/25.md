"An understanding of every language-technical detail of a language feature or library component is neither necessary nor sufficient for writing good programs. In fact, an obsession with understanding every little detail is a prescription for awful – overelaborate and overly clever – code. What is needed is an understanding of design and programming techniques together with an appreciation of application domains"

## Two principles of C++:
- Leave no room for a lower-level language below C++ (except for assembly code in rare cases). If you can write more efficient code in a lower-level language then that language will most likely become the systems programming language of choice.
- What you don’t use you don’t pay for. If programmers can hand-write reasonable code to simulate a language feature or a fundamental abstraction and provide even slightly better performance, someone will do so, and many will imitate. Therefore, a language feature and a fundamental abstraction must be designed not to waste a single byte or a single processor cycle compared to equivalent alternatives. This is known as the zero-overhead principle

## The C++ language features most directly support four programming styles:
- Procedural programming
- Data abstraction
- Object-oriented programming
- Generic programming
