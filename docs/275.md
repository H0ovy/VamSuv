## Error Handling

The error() function  simply  counts  the  errors,  writes  out  an  error  message, and returns:

    int no_of_errors;

    double error(const string& s)
    {
        no_of_errors++;
        cerr << "error: " << s << '\n';
        return 1;
    }

The stream `cerr` is an unbuffered output stream usually used to report errors.
The reason for returning a value is that errors typically occur in the middle of the evaluation of an expression, so we should either abort that evaluation entirely or return a value that is unlikely to cause subsequent errors.

## Operator Precedence

    f (0 <= x <= 99) // ...

This is legal, but it is interpreted as `(0<=x)<=99`, where the result of the first comparison is either `true` or `false`. This  Boolean  value  is  then  implicitly  converted  to `1` or `0`, which  is  then  compared  to `99`, yielding `true`. To test whether `x` is in the range `0..99`, we might use

    if (0<=x && x<=99) // ...

## Conditional Expressions

Some `if`-statements can conveniently be replaced by conditional-expressions. For example:

    if (a <= b)
        max = b;
    else
        max = a;

This is more directly expressed like this:

    max = (a<=b) ? b : a;

If `a<=b` = `true` than `max` becomes `b`, if `false` it becomes `a`
