## `#include` Guards

The traditional solution is to insert include guards in headers. For example:

    // error.h:

    #ifndef CALC_ERROR_H
    #define CALC_ERROR_H

    namespace Error {
        // ...
    }

    #endif // CALC_ERROR_H

The contents of the file between the `#ifndef` and `#endif` are ignored by the compiler if `CALC_ERROR_H` is defined. Thus, the first time `error.h` is seen during a compilation, its contents are read and `CALC_ERROR_H` is given a value.  Should the compiler be presented with `error.h` again during the compilation, the contents are ignored.
